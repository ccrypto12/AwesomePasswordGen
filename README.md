# AwesomePasswordGen that ChatGPT assisted me in making. (I'm not a programmer, just an old dude who likes experimenting with things.  I did do the html/css, which may not be your taste, but you can change it to anything you desire. )

Here we have a password generator that uses a keyword and a master key to generate strong passwords.  
It uses CryptoJS.SHA256 salt, https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/crypto-js/4.0.0/crypto-js.min.js and https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/seedrandom/3.0.5/seedrandom.min.js

I got the inspiration to make this because I always liked the Password Hasher Addon for Firefox  That can be found here:  https://github.com/wijjo/passhash and the main Password Hasher page can be found here: https://wijjo.com/passhash (I still use passhash to this day).

AwesomePasswordGen is just my rendition that can be used on any device.

It will make password lengths from 14 characters to 128 characters, just type the number you want in.
It works exactly the same as the Password Hasher Firefox addon, with the exception that it uses SHA256 instead of SHA1.
It will be hosted here for you to use.

I hope you like it, and of course, do whatever you want with it.
