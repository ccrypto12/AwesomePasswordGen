# AwesomePasswordGen - Generate Strong Passwords.  Thanks ChatGPT!

Here we have a password generator (Co Created with ChatGPT) that uses a keyword and a master key to generate strong passwords.  
It uses CryptoJS.SHA256 salt, https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/crypto-js/4.0.0/crypto-js.min.js and https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/seedrandom/3.0.5/seedrandom.min.js

From the page: 

    Generates strong and unique passwords based on a Site Tag and Master Key (any word or phrase you like).
    Forget about having to remember every password, you only need to remember the master key.
    Ensures strong passwords with a mix of characters, excluding lookalike characters.
    Provides unique passwords for each combination of Site Tag and master keyword.
    Enhances online security by reducing the risk of password reuse.
    Displays the generated password conveniently for easy viewing and copying.
    Supports cross-platform compatibility for accessibility on various devices.
    Encourages users to adopt strong password practices for improved online security.

I got the inspiration to make this because I always liked the Password Hasher Addon for Firefox  That can be found here:  https://github.com/wijjo/passhash and the main Password Hasher page can be found here: https://wijjo.com/passhash (I still use passhash to this day).

AwesomePasswordGen is just my rendition that can be used on any device.

It will make password lengths from 14 characters to 128 characters, just type the number you want in.
It works exactly the same as the Password Hasher Firefox addon, with the exception that it uses SHA256 instead of SHA1.
It will be hosted here for you to use.

I hope you like it, and of course, do whatever you want with it.
